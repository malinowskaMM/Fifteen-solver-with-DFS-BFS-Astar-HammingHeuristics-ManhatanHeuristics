# Fifteen Puzzle Solver

An academic project developed independently to solve the classic Fifteen Puzzle using a variety of search algorithms and heuristic strategies. I was fully responsible for the design and implementation of the solution, focusing on both algorithm correctness and performance optimization.

# My role:

- Designed and implemented the complete logic of the solver from scratch.
- Selected and applied appropriate search algorithms and heuristic functions.
- Ensured modularity and readability by following clean code and OOP principles.

# Key Features:

Solves the Fifteen Puzzle using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.
Incorporates the A* search algorithm with both Manhattan Distance and Hamming Distance heuristics.
Outputs detailed solution paths along with performance statistics (e.g., number of states explored, execution time).
Demonstrates practical application of graph traversal, heuristic search, and combinatorial optimization.

# Technologies:

- Java
- Java Collections Framework (Queue, Stack, PriorityQueue)
- Custom comparator and state modeling
